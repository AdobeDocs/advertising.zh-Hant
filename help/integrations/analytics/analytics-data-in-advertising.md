# [!DNL Analytics] Data in Adobe Advertising

*僅整合Adobe Advertising-Adobe Analytics的廣告商*

## Analytics segments

All segments created in [!DNL Analytics] and published to Adobe CX Enterprise (formerly Adobe) Experience Cloud).

New segments take 24-48 hours to appear in Adobe Advertising. Updates to existing segments are synchronized within about eight hours.

<!-- I added "metric" to some of the links below, even though it looks redundant, because of syntax limitations: If you use [!DNL] or [!UICONTROL] as the sole text of a link (such as [[!UICONTROL Revenue]], the tag is included in the link text (such as "[!UICONTROL Revenue]") when it's published. -->

## Site engagement metrics

>[!NOTE]
>
>* [!DNL Analytics] passes events for the EF ID [!DNL eVar] into Adobe Advertising.  The default integration doesn&#39;t support sending calculated metrics or other dimensions ([!DNL eVars]) into Adobe Advertising. If the calculated metric can be wholly captured in a custom event, however, then Adobe Advertising can ingest the custom event.
>* [!DNL Analytics] passes data to Adobe Advertising hourly.

* [!UICONTROL Timespent_secs_1stvisit]: The number of seconds spent on the site during the visitor&#39;s first visit.
* [!UICONTROL Timespent_secs_total]: The total number of seconds spent on the site across all visits within the click lookback window.
* [!UICONTROL Pageviews_1stvisit]: The number of page views on the site during the visitor&#39;s first visit.
* [!UICONTROL Pageviews_total]: The total number of page views on the site across all visits within the click lookback window.
* [[!UICONTROL Bounces] metric](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/metrics/bounces.html)
* [[!UICONTROL Visits] metric](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/metrics/visits.html)
