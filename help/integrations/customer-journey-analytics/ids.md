# Customer Journey Analytics使用的Adobe Advertising ID

*僅整合Adobe Advertising-Adobe Customer Journey Analytics的廣告商*

*適用於Advertising DSP和[!DNL Advertising Search, Social, & Commerce]*

*Beta功能*

Adobe Advertising使用兩個ID進行網站上的效能追蹤： *EF ID*&#x200B;和&#x200B;*AMO ID*。

<!--
 Rewrite for CJA:

When an ad impression occurs, Adobe Advertising creates the AMO ID and EF ID values and stores them. For click-through traffic, these IDs are included in the landing page URL using the `ef_id` and `s_kwcid` (for the AMO ID) query string parameters.

Adobe Advertising distinguishes between a click-through or view-through entry to the website using the following criteria:

* A view-through entry is captured when a user visits the site after viewing an ad but not clicking it. [!DNL Analytics] or Web SDK records a view-through if two conditions are met:

    * The visitor has no click-throughs for a [!DNL DSP] or [!DNL Search, Social, & Commerce] ad during the [click lookback window](/help/integrations/analytics/prerequisites.md#lookback-a4adc).

    * The visitor has seen at least one [!DNL DSP] ad during the [impression lookback window](/help/integrations/analytics/prerequisites.md#lookback-a4adc). The last impression is passed as the view-through.

* A click-through entry is captured when a site visitor clicks an ad before entering the site. [!DNL Analytics] or Web SDK captures a click-through when either of the following conditions occurs:

    * The URL includes an EF ID and AMO ID as added to the landing page URL by Adobe Advertising.

    * The URL contains no tracking codes, but the Adobe Advertising JavaScript code detects a click within the last two minutes.

### AMO ID Dimension in [!DNL Customer Journey Analytics]

In Analytics reports, you can find AMO ID data by searching for the [!UICONTROL AMO ID] dimension and using the [!UICONTROL AMO ID Instances] metric. The [!UICONTROL AMO ID] dimension houses all AMO ID values captured, whereas the [!UICONTROL AMO ID Instances] metric indicates how often an AMO ID value was captured by the site. For example, if the same search ad was clicked four times but Analytics tracked seven site entries, then [!UICONTROL AMO ID Instances] would be seven (7) and [!UICONTROL Clicks] would be four (4).

For any reporting or auditing within [!DNL Analytics], the best practice is to use the AMO ID along with its corresponding instance. For more information, see "[Click-through data validation for [!DNL Analytics for Advertising]](data-variances.md#data-validation)" in "Expected data variances between [!DNL Analytics] and Adobe Advertising."
