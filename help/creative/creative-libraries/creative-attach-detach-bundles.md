# 將創意內容附加至創意組合

<!-- Edit all, including the metadata and title, plus the links within TOC and bundle-manage.md, once this feature is available.  -->

您可以將標準顯示創意附加至標準顯示組合，將標準視訊創意附加至標準視訊組合，以及將動態顯示創意附加至動態顯示組合，以便將其新增至[廣告體驗](/help/creative/experiences/experience-about.md)。 每個組合只能包含每個\[創意大小或持續時間+語言\]組合之一。

<!--
You can also detach a creative from a bundle to remove the association between the two, so that the creative is no longer used for experiences that target the bundle. Detaching a creative from the bundle doesn't delete the creative from the Creatives tab in your creative library.

## Detach creatives from a creative bundle
